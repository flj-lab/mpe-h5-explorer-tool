# mpe-exporter
Enables users familiar with MATLAB style plotting to work with HDF5 datafiles generated by MTS Multipurpose Elite (MPE). 
## The Problem:
The nature of some of the high-cycle fatigue tests we were running meant MPE was unable to export raw data to `.csv` files, likely because the data is long enough to exceed the RAM limit on the machine when writting to `.csv`. Teammembers need to be able to export the data and generate our own custom plots, but are generally not familiar with most large-dataset formats.

## The Solution
MPE uses [Hierarchical Data Format 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) (HDF5, file extension `.h5`) to save data internally, HDF5 files are a lot smaller and quicker to work with than the more human-readable `.csv` files. The `mpe-exporter` tool is intended to help lab members produce useful data visualizations in a way that is fairly similar to what they're used to in MATLAB. It uses `h5py` and `numpy` to interact with the HDF5 data files, assuming they are formatted in the manner typical of MPE datasets. The tools are designed to extract relevant information from `.h5` files and expose it to the user, without them having to worry about the particulars of HDF5 data. See [`example_main.py`](./example_main.py) for an example of how to use the toolset.

# Download

## 1. Install Python
If you don't already have Python installed, you'll need to install it.
- **Windows**: Download the latest Python 3 installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). **Important**: During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" and also ensure that "tcl/tk and IDLE" is selected (this is usually selected by default and is needed for graphical elements).
- **Linux**: Python 3 is often pre-installed. You can check by opening a terminal and typing `python3 --version`. If it's not installed, or you need a specific version, use your distribution's package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-tk
  ```
  For Fedora:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip python3-tkinter
  ```

## 2. Download This Tool
You can download this tool in one of two ways:
*   **Option A: Download ZIP**
    1.  Go to the GitHub repository page.
    2.  Click the green "<> Code" button.
    3.  Select "Download ZIP".
    4.  Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.

    7.  Click "Clone".

## 3. Install Requirements
After downloading, navigate into the project's root directory (e.g., `mpe-exporter`) in your terminal or command prompt. Then, run the appropriate setup script for your operating system. This will create a Python virtual environment and install the necessary packages.

### For Windows Users:
1.  Open a Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you downloaded/extracted the tool (e.g., `cd path\to\mpe-exporter`).
3.  Run the setup script:
    ```batch
    setup_windows.bat
    ```

### For Linux Users:
1.  Open a terminal.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you downloaded/cloned the tool (e.g., `cd path/to/mpe-exporter`).
3.  Make the setup script executable: `chmod +x setup_linux.sh`
4.  Run the setup script: `./setup_linux.sh`
